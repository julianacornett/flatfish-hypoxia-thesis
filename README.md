# flatfish-hypoxia-thesis
This repository includes all data, lab protocols, and R scripts associated with the MS thesis **"Physiological Responses to Hypoxia in Juvenile Flatfishes"** by Juliana Cornett. This repository is organized into the following folders:

## [Protocols](Protocols)

This folder includes lab protocols (.pdf) used for this thesis project. The [Protocols](Protocols) folder is divided into sub-folders based on the type of physiological response measurements/methods (e.g., "Tissue_Assays"). See [Protocols_README](Protocols/Protocols_README.md) within the [Protocols](Protocols) folder for more details. 

## [Data and Scripts](Data&Scripts)

This folder includes all data files (.csv) and R scripts (.Rmd) used for data analysis and figures in the written thesis. The [Data and Scripts](Data&Scripts) folder is organized into sub-folders containing both data files and R scripts associated with a particular category of physiological response measurements (e.g., "Metabolic Responses"), with the exception of the "PCA" folder (organized by analysis) since this analysis includes multiple categories of data. See [Data&Scripts_README](Data&Scripts/Data&Scripts_README.md) within the [Data and Scripts](Data&Scripts) folder for more details.
